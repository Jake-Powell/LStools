<p>Within the data each row contains information about an individual
student, in our case whether they are classed as receiving free school
meals (FSM), and their maths grades at KS1 (5 years old), KS2 (11 years
old), GCSE (16 years old) and whether they do maths at A-levels (18
years old). The students grades are grouped at the various levels
mirroring the proportion of students taken from the maths pipeline
report (figure XX). Note that the columns must be cast by factor with
the order in which you want the â€˜nodesâ€™ to appear (i.e in our case
highest level to lowest level).</p>

<p>Or to save the underlying information in the sankey diagram to
formatted .xlsx file you can use the function
<code><a href="../reference/sankey_export_xlsx.html">sankey_export_xlsx()</a></code>, which allows a title and source to be
added to the spreadsheet (needed for statistical disclosure). This
method creates a spreadsheet with the columns â€˜Sourceâ€™, â€˜Targetâ€™ and
â€˜Number of Studentsâ€™ describing the flow between all nodes in the
diagram. If we are saving a filtered sankey diagram another column will
be added informing whether the flow relates to the traced or non-traced
students.</p>
